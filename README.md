<h1 align="center">Simorgh - Secure File Transfer Project</h1>
Simorgh is a Python-based application for securely storing and transferring files. The application takes a file, encrypts it, and sends the encrypted file to a cloud storage via an API call. It then generates a 20-character password and an 8-digit ID that are required to decrypt the file.
To retrieve the sent files, users must enter the password and ID to download the file from the cloud storage and decrypt it using the password.

This application utilizes the tkinter module for creating its graphical user interface.

<h3>Why Simorgh?</h3>
The name "Simorgh" is used in this project to symbolize the mythical bird in Persian literature and mythology. Just like the Simorgh bird, which is said to possess great wisdom and power, this project aims to provide a secure and reliable method for transferring files while maintaining the confidentiality of the data.
